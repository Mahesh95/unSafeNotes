It takes notes, saves them to a local sqlite database. Notes can be saved with 	a tag like “poetry” and direct access to notes with tag “poetry” from the navigation 	drawer, so that you can have a look at all your poetry, Besides that you can also directly	search for a particular note. You can also delete and edit notes.
